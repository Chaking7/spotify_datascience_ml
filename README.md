required packages: pandas numpy matplotlib math spotipy

To get spotipys credentials to work, you need to provide a client id, client secret, and redirect uri, which you can get this information by starting a project through spotify for developers.Â

This project can currently create a ploty visualization for the for a spotify playlist given the playlist uri. 
The next steps are to turn my hard code into objects and create an effective way of visualizing multiple songs, 
and separately, a way of getting an effective visualizations for averages of these features throughout the playlist. After I am happy with visualizations and can use them to visually compare playlists, 
and albums, I will be moving to using the data for machine learning. From here I am focused on creating a simple predictor for what songs I might enjoy either based on preset select songs, or a large 
database, hopefully using this idea to learn cloud computing for machine learning.
